What an interesting combination! Here's a simple and refreshing recipe you can try:

**Grape Infused Vinegar Drink**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup grapes (any variety)
* 2 tablespoons vinegar (apple cider or white wine work well)

Instructions:

1. Cut the grapes in half to release their juice.
2. Add the grape halves to a clean water bottle.
3. Pour in the cup of water, making sure the grapes are fully submerged.
4. Let it sit at room temperature for 2-3 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. This will allow the grapes to infuse into the water and release their natural sweetness.
5. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the grape solids. Discard the solids or save them for another use (like making a homemade jam).
6. Add the vinegar to the grape-infused water. Stir well to combine.
7. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator before serving.

Enjoy your unique and flavorful drink! The sweetness of the grapes pairs nicely with the tanginess of the vinegar, creating a refreshing beverage perfect for hot summer days or as a pick-me-up anytime.

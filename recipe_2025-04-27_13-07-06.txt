A lot of onions! Don't worry, I'm happy to help you come up with a delicious recipe using those onions and butternut squashes.

Considering the abundance of onions, I'll suggest a hearty and flavorful recipe that celebrates their sweetness. Here's a simple yet tasty idea:

**Roasted Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Soup**

Ingredients (assuming you have some pantry staples like chicken broth, olive oil, salt, pepper, and herbs):

* 2 butternut squashes
* 4-5 onions, peeled and chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Chicken broth or vegetable broth (about 4 cups)
* Fresh herbs like parsley or thyme (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Peel, seed, and chop the butternut squashes into 1-inch cubes.
3. In a large bowl, toss the squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper until they're evenly coated. Spread them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for about 30-40 minutes, or until tender and caramelized.
4. Meanwhile, caramelize the onions by heating the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the chopped onions and cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they're dark golden brown and sweet.
5. Once the squash is done roasting, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly. Then, add the roasted squash to the caramelized onion mixture in the skillet. Stir well to combine.
6. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or herbs to taste.
8. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or thyme if desired.
